README for MultiTidalPoly setup.

----

BEFORE RUNNING THIS SETUP:

1. After installing this setup into SimulationMain, use the following setup line to compile:

	./setup MultiTidalPoly -noclobber -maxblocks=1000 -nxb=8 -nyb=8 -nzb=8 -auto -3d -objdir=object_multitidalpoly +pm4dev +newMpole

2. Copy the file "amr_runtime_paramaters" that is generated by the setup routine in the object directory to your run directory.

----

The default setup needs ~8 cores or more to run at all. ~64 cores to finish within a reasonable amount of time.
